#+title: .emacs.d
#+subtitle: my emacs configuration files

This is the repository where I keep my emacs configuration files.
These files should be portable (install on any working emacs),
but may not work on not the newest major versions of emacs (27 currently).

If you encounter some issue with portability, feel free to submit an issue,
I may or may not silently ignore you. :3
